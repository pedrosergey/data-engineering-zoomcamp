# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 🚀
*5th Edition*

This repo is my personal playground for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club — a hands-on course that teaches modern data engineering practices, from data ingestion to analytics and orchestration.

As a data analyst / data engineer, I'm taking this zoomcamp to level up my skills, build production-ready data pipelines, and master the essential tools of the data engineering ecosystem. Expect notes, projects, experiments, and code that help me put concepts into practice.

## 📚 Course modules

### [Module 1: Docker & Terraform](01-docker-terraform/)
**Containerization and Infrastructure as Code**

Learn the fundamentals of modern infrastructure management:
- 🐳 **Docker**: Containerize data pipelines, set up PostgreSQL databases, use Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
- ☁️ **Terraform**: Provision GCP resources (BigQuery, GCS) using infrastructure as code
- 🗃️ **Data Ingestion**: Build ETL pipelines to ingest NYC taxi data into PostgreSQL
- 📊 **SQL**: Query and analyze data in containerized databases

**Key technologies**: Docker, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Terraform, GCP, BigQuery

### [Module 2: Workflow Orchestration](02-workflow-orchestration/)
**Pipeline orchestration with modern workflow tools**

Build and orchestrate end-to-end data workflows:
- 🔄 **Orchestration**: Define and run scheduled workflows with Kestra
- 🐳 **Containers**: Run orchestration services and dependencies with Docker Compose
- 🗄️ **Data services**: Connect orchestrated jobs to PostgreSQL and supporting services
- 🔐 **Configuration**: Manage environment variables and service credentials for local development

**Key technologies**: Kestra, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Python, SQL

## What you'll find here
- 📊 Hands-on projects and homework assignments from the course
- 🛠️ Practical examples covering data ingestion, transformation, warehousing, and analytics engineering
- 🐍 Code for working with tools like Docker, SQL, Terraform, dbt, Spark, and more
- 📝 Detailed READMEs and documentation for each module

## Why I'm doing this
I want to build robust, scalable data pipelines and deepen my understanding of the modern data stack — from ingestion to visualization. This repo documents the journey and makes it easy to track progress and reproduce the experiments.

## Thanks
Big thanks to the DataTalks.Club team and Alexei for creating this amazing free course and providing excellent materials — this repo builds on their work and is inspired by their teaching. 🙏
