# Module 1: Docker & Terraform

This module covers the fundamentals of containerization with Docker and infrastructure as code with Terraform, two essential tools in modern data engineering.

## 📂 What's in this module

### [docker/](docker/)
Docker containerization for data pipelines:
- PostgreSQL database setup with Docker
- Python scripts for data ingestion
- Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
- Dockerfiles for creating custom images
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and development

**Key concepts**: Containers, volumes, networking, docker-compose, building images

### [terraform/](terraform/)
Infrastructure as code using Terraform to provision Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources:
- BigQuery dataset creation
- GCP project configuration
- Terraform state management
- Variable-based infrastructure definitions

**Key concepts**: IaC, Terraform providers, resources, state management, GCP integration

### [homework/](homework/)
Solutions and exercises from the module's homework assignments, including:
- Docker command practice
- SQL queries on NYC taxi data
- Docker networking challenges
- Terraform resource creation

## 🎯 Learning objectives

By completing this module, you'll be able to:
- Containerize Python data pipelines with Docker
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container applications
- Write Terraform configurations to provision cloud infrastructure
- Manage infrastructure state and variables securely
- Set up PostgreSQL databases in containers
- Ingest and query data in containerized environments

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Docker**: Navigate to the `docker/` folder and check the README for setup instructions
2. **Terraform**: Navigate to the `terraform/` folder to learn about provisioning GCP resources
3. **Homework**: Complete the exercises in the `homework/` folder to practice what you've learned

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Terraform CLI installed
- GCP account with billing enabled (for Terraform section)
- Basic knowledge of command line, Python, and SQL

---

💡 **Tip**: Start with Docker to understand containerization basics before moving to Terraform for cloud infrastructure provisioning.
